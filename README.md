<h1>Matrix Trace</h1>
<h5>The program takes in the dimensions of the matrix from the user, i.e., the number of columns and rows. It then fills the matrix with random numbers ranging from 0 to 100 (inclusive).</h5>

<p>The program then calculates the matrix trace, which is the sum of all elements on the main diagonal. The main diagonal is the diagonal that starts from the top left corner and finishes in the bottom right corner for square matrices. 
For rectangle matrices, the main diagonal is the line that starts in the top left corner and moves right and down until the border (bottom or right) of the matrix is reached.</p>

<h5>After building the matrix, the program waits for user input:</h4>

1 - Rebuild the same matrix again </br>
2 - Print the main diagonal </br>
3 - Build a new matrix </br>
Esc - Exit the program
